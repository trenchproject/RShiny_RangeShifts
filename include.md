## Range shifts

##Introduction

Changes in climate may cause species to shift their geographic ranges in order to track a set of environmental conditions. Previous studies of single species and targeted species groups have found that, for many species, ranges are moving toward the poles and upwards in elevation as the climate warms. However, targeted studies risk focusing on groups likely to respond to climate change, and results in a given system or region may not apply globally. 

##Data

For this activity we will be working with data from Chen et al. 2011 , a study analyzing the results of 23 peer-reviewed studies of changes in species’ ranges over time. Each row of the table “Ex3_rangedata.xls” corresponds to a previously published peer-reviewed study carried out on a defined taxonomic and geographic group. For example, row 1 summarizes the results of a study of range shifts of butterflies in Finland. 

The column for “Mean observed shift” corresponds to the average distance away from the poles that species’ ranges moved during the study period. Negative values indicate movement towards the equator. “SE observed shift” is the standard error of shift distances between species in each study. Standard error is a measure of the amount of variability in a dataset (specifically, the standard error is: SE=SD/sqrt(n), where SD is the standard deviation and n is the sample size). The “Expected shift” column was calculated by finding the distance that species would have to have shifted in order to experience the same climate at the end of each study period as they did at the beginning. Another way of thinking of this is: 

expected shift (km) = velocity of climate change (km/year) * duration (years)

The “Duration” column gives the number of years each study covers. “Temperature Change” is the change in average annual temperature (°C) observed in the ranges of focal species over the period covered by surveys.  

##Questions

Use the Chen 2011 data to respond to the following prompts. Include your answers and any supporting charts in a word document or PDF. 
1.	What is the average observed speed (km/year) of latitudinal range shifts? 
2.	Did species experiencing more warming show greater observed range shifts? Produce a plot supporting your answer.
