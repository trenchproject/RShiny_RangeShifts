## Range Shifts: How Marine Taxa Track A Shifting Climate

### M.A.D. - Move, Adapt, or Die

Global warming has created shifting environmental conditions for populations of organisms. Previously suitable ranges have become unsuitable. Organisms respond in one of three ways when faced with their climate changing: moving to a more suitable location, adapting to the new climate, or dying. In this visualization, we will focus on organisms moving to “follow” their suitable climate as it shifts.     

### Shifting ranges and the importance of microclimate

The expected shifts of populations are (1) polewards, (2) up in elevation, and (3) deeper in water. These shifts are intuitive: wolves moving their range north, bird populations moving up mountains, and fish moving to deeper waters. ([Refer to the TrEnCh-Ed explanation of climatic gradients for more info.](https://trench-ed.github.io/#gradients)) However, the reality of range shifting has proven more complex, and up to 60% of both marine and terrestrial species are not shifting as expected.    

It’s important to remember that organisms don’t respond to global trends, they respond to the microclimate trends of the mountainside, terrain, and water they are in. An organism's preferred microclimate may move away from them quicker, slower, or in a whole other direction that the overall climate trend of “north, higher, and deeper.” A population's suitable microclimate shifting away is measured as “climate velocity.” Climate velocity is the answer to the question: How fast would a species need to move to keep up with climate change? For populations, being unable to keep up with this climate velocity can be fatal.    

### Marine climate velocities and thermal envelopes

For marine life, suitable microclimates are often referred to as “thermal envelopes.” This thermal envelope encompases the three-dimensional space in the water in which the temperature is suitable for that population to live (latitude, longitude, depth). The movement of that thermal envelope is it’s climate velocity. Climate velocities are up to seven times higher in the ocean than on land.    

In the ocean, currents and tides play a large role in the differences between populations' climate velocities. A lobster in the northeast with calm waters may have its thermal envelope’s climate velocity slowly headed poleward, whereas a big skate on the west coast near a strong ocean current may have its thermal envelope’s climate velocity headed quickly south. Some populations find their thermal envelope remaining stable longitudinally and latitudinally, but moving shallower or deeper.    

### The data

*Shifts in the distribution of marine taxa. (A) Vectors show the average shift in latitude and longitude for each taxon (colors) and the mean shift in each region (black). Insets show the mean (black), maximum (blue), and minimum (red) latitude of detection for Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) in the Gulf of Alaska, big skate (Raja binoculata) on the U.S. West Coast, and American lobster (Homarus americanus) in the Northeast. Gray dashed lines in insets indicate the range of surveyed latitudes. Detailed views are also shown of (B) the Eastern Bering Sea, (C) the Gulf of Mexico, and (D) Newfoundland.*   

  

The data was compiled from four decades of scientific surveys of fish and invertebrates from the continental shelves of North America across nine regions spanning ~3.3 million km^2 and 60,394 bottom-trawl samples from 1968 to 2011. These surveys captured 128 million organisms from 580 populations of 360 species or species groups; collectively referred to as “taxa”. Range shifts were measured by tracking the location of the center of population range.    

This data shows a strong relationship between local climate velocity and marine range shifts. Across all taxa, 74% shifted latitude in the same direction as climate velocity, and 70% shifted depth in the same direction. This explanatory power was equally high for “non-intuitive” shifts that deviate from the poleward-and-deeper pattern: 73% of shifts to lower latitudes and 75% of shifts toward shallower water were explained by climate velocity.    

### How to use this app

This visualization features two plots. Both show the taxa chosen in the filter on the left side in the region selected. Each data point represents a population of a marine species.    

The latitude plot shows the northern climate velocity of that population’s thermal envelope against the population’s observed northern range shift. The depth plot shows the depth climate velocity of that population’s thermal envelope against the population’s observed depth range shift. The line plotted on each graph is a 1-to-1 line. If a data point lands exactly on the 1-to-1 line, that population shifted exactly as much (degree north or depth) as it’s thermal envelope.
