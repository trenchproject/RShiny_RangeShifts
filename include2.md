##Question
3.	Produce a scatter plot of observed (y-axis) versus expected (x-axis) range shifts, and include standard error bars on each point.  Add a one-to-one line (a line with the equation: y=x) .
a.	How many studies documented greater than expected range shifts? Less than expected?
b.	According to this data, are species “keeping up” with the pace of climate change?

4.	What is one shortcoming of this dataset that makes it difficult to generalize the findings to all global ecosystems?

5.	In your opinion, do these results provide convincing evidence that species’ ranges are shifting in response to climate change? Why, or why not?
